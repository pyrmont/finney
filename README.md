# Finney README

Finney is a simple Node.js script that outputs modified versions of the NHK radio podcasts (in English and Japanese). In the case of the English podcast, it only outputs the 9 pm episode and in the case of the Japanese podcast it only outputs the 7 am episode.

## Requirements

Finney requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to be installed on your system.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/pyrmont/finney.git  # Warning: read-only.
cd finney
npm install
```

Once you have installed Finney, you will need to create an ```output``` directory.
